| `accountId` | `string` | Unique identifier of the account. In Mixpanel, this will appear as Distinct ID. |
| `body` | `object` | Account details. The `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, and `created` are predefined properties but are not required. If `created` is omitted, it defaults to `new Date()`. Any additional custom properties can be added. Values with types of `Buffer` or `ObjectID` are serialized into string using [bs58](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs58).|

```typescript
analytics.setAccount({
  accountId: 'unique-id-123',
  body: {
    firstname: 'juan',
    lastname: 'bautista',
    email: 'juan.bautista@mail.com',
    created: new Date(),
    customPropertyA: 'hello',
    customPropertyB: 'hi',
  }
});
```

| `body` | `object` | Properties relevant to the event. Values with types of `Buffer` or `ObjectID` are serialized into string using [bs58](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs58). |
